# BOTW-Guide
I couldn't be bothered helping people to get and play BOTW in the alternative way so I made this. Enjoy

# Downloading CEMU
Download [CEMU](https://cemu.info/releases/cemu_1.27.1.zip) and extract.
Open the Cemu.exe, where you will be greeted by a 'Getting Started' window (This only happens when you first open it)

Create a folder in a safe location named "mlc01"

Leave the "Game path" field blank

Click "Download community graphic packs"

Click Next

N.B The "mlc01" folder The mlc01 path stores the emulated Wii U internal memory, including:

System files and apps

Installed games, updates and DLC's

User-created save data

This should be on a storage drive that Cemu will always have access to, with lots of free space. By default, the mlc01 path will be stored in the Cemu directory.

If you delete this folder everything will be gone. If this path ever gets reset, make sure to set it again in Options -> General settings -> MLC Path

# Downloading BOTW
Download [BOTW](https://archive.org/download/nintendo-wii-u-usa-full-set-wua-format-embedded-dlc-updates/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20-%20Breath%20of%20the%20Wild%20%28USA%29%20%28DLC%29%20%28v208%29.wua)
in a ROM folder, just to keep everything organised.

It's as simple as that

# Setting Up CEMU

- On the top bar, go to Options -> Input settings
- Change Emulated controller to "Wii U GamePad"
- Click on the Controller field
- Set API to "SDLController"
- Set Controller to your actual controller. If no controller appears after connecting it to your computer, try changing your controller API
- Proceed to map all your controller button inputs
- At the top, enter in a controller profile name, e.g. "GamePad Controller"
- Click Save
